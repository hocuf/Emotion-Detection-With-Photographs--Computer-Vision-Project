# Emotion Detection With Photographs Computer Vision Project


This project is focused on improving the overall happiness and wellbeing of people in different communal environments. The goal is to achieve this by leveraging the deepface library, which is a powerful facial recognition and analysis tool, to perform emotional analysis on a collection of 100 photographs.

By using this library to analyze facial expressions and other visual cues, the project seeks to gain insights into the emotional states of individuals within a given setting. This data can then be used to inform decisions and strategies aimed at enhancing happiness and satisfaction among people in that environment.

The project's potential applications are varied and can include anything from improving employee morale in an office setting to enhancing the customer experience in a retail or hospitality environment. Ultimately, the project aims to help create happier and more positive environments for people to work, shop, and interact in.
